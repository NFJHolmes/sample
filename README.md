# sample
This is a sample of two separate projects
1. A javascript project using turborepo, sveltekit, typescript, tailwindcss. This is just one of the apps under the /app turborepo directory.
2. A "bookings" route of a rust webservice. Each route in this project consisted of a router, handler, service, repo, and model. Bookings was one of the more complicated ones so it also included utils and emails.
